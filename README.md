# LipNet

## 🔍 Overview

**LipNet** is a deep learning model for lipreading full sentences from natural, unconstrained videos. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to interpret visual cues from lip movements and transcribe them into spoken phrases.

This repository includes everything required to train, test, and evaluate the LipNet model.

## ✨ Features

- **Lipreading in the Wild**: Handles real-world scenarios with varying speaker appearances, lighting, and backgrounds.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and RNNs for temporal sequence modeling.
- **Training Pipeline**: Tools to train LipNet on labeled lip video datasets with transcripts.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes evaluation scripts using Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER).
- **Pre-trained Models**: Optionally available pre-trained weights for quick deployment and testing.
